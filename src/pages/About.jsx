        Dedicated and results-oriented professional, Diego Cornejo, 
        with a strong academic foundation in Computer Science, recently 
        enrolled in a prestigious online bootcamp to further enhance skills 
        and expertise. Over the course of two years of intensive study, I 
        have acquired a comprehensive understanding of a diverse range of 
        technologies for both front-end and back-end development. Eager to 
        transition into the role of a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, 
        Node.js) developer, I am poised to apply my proficiency in 
        cutting-edge technologies and programming languages to contribute 
        effectively to dynamic and challenging projects. With a keen eye for 
        detail and a passion for delivering high-quality solutions, I am 
        excited to leverage my knowledge and embark on a fulfilling career in 
        software development.
